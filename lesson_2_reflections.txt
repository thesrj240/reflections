We need to use git init to tell git to init a repo
It creates necessary metadata for the repo

staging area comes between wd and repo
you can choose what you want to commit using staging area

git diff without args compares wd with last commit
git diff   - compare wd with staging area
git diff --staged   - compare staging area with last commit

staging area can be used to ensure one logical change per commit
by not adding all the files to the staging area at once

branches are good for experimentation
developing new features 
without fear of breaking the master

merging gives side effects with diff
so use git show <branch>
this will show only the changes from the parent
